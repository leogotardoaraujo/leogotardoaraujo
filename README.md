Presentation Letter
Hi, my name is Leonardo Gotardo Araujo. I’m here to write a little about 
myself as a person and my professional objectives and personal growth.
I’d like to start mentioning that I’m an eager learner and I like to specialize 
myself in subjects that I’m working on, and I believe I’m making the difference. 
Including opportunities that I don’t have much knowledge about. I’d like to start 
being part of the team not only fulfilling the team, but with the pleasure of learning 
in any role I’m in, considering that in some cases I need to learn first. I have this 
kind of thinking because I’m a quick learning person, also I’m a good worker, as 
an individual or as part of a group. 
In some subjects areas I don’t a very hard skill development, that is a fact, 
though I’m an easy going person and anywhere I go I believe I can make things 
work out.
I’m currently graduating at Mechanical Engineering, at Federal University 
of Uberlândia, Brazil. I’m looking forward to have new learnings and acquire more 
work and life experience. I have the knowledge in some programming languages 
such as C, Python and MatLab. Related to my past professional experience, I’ve 
been an English Teacher, in recognized institution (Wizard by Pearson) and a 
Digital Designer freelancer, using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, in the 
past year. Finally, I’m looking to improve my third language, French.
